# Stockify Development Tasks

This document presents development tasks aimed at improving the Spring Boot-based infrastructure and features of the Stockify project, prioritized and detailed from a Spring expert's perspective. Each task is listed with its expected impact, suggested Spring technologies, and estimated difficulty level.

## ✅ Architecture Improvements

| ID | Task | Priority | Difficulty | Description |
|----|------|----------|------------|-------------|
| A1 | Refactor to layered architecture (Controller → Service → Repository) | 🔴 High | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Clarify the layered architecture according to Spring best practices (Presentation: @RestController, Business: @Service, Data Access: @Repository annotations) to enhance code readability, testability, and maintainability. |
| A2 | Implement global exception handler with custom exceptions | 🔴 High | ⭐⭐⭐ | Provide centralized error management for the entire API using Spring's @ControllerAdvice and @ExceptionHandler mechanisms. Create custom RuntimeException-derived exception classes for business rules to produce clear and standard error messages (with ErrorResponse DTOs). |
| A3 | Add caching for frequently accessed endpoints (Spring Cache) | 🟡 Medium | ⭐⭐⭐ | Improve performance for frequently accessed data (e.g., product lists, category information) by using Spring Cache (@EnableCaching, @Cacheable, @CacheEvict). Integrate a suitable cache provider (e.g., Caffeine, Redis). |
| A4 | Add i18n support with messages.properties | 🟢 Low | ⭐⭐⭐ | Implement internationalization using Spring's MessageSource and ResourceBundleMessageSource. Start with Turkish and English. |

## 🧼 Code Quality Improvements

| ID | Task | Priority | Difficulty | Description |
|----|------|----------|------------|-------------|
| C1 | Replace @Autowired fields with constructor injection | 🔴 High | ⭐⭐ | Switch to constructor injection for more reliable and testable dependency management. |
| C2 | Introduce Lombok for models | 🟡 Medium | ⭐⭐ | Use Lombok annotations to reduce boilerplate code in model classes. |
| C4 | Add @Valid and Bean Validation annotations | 🔴 High | ⭐⭐ | Use Bean Validation (JSR 380) annotations (@NotNull, @Size, @Email, @Pattern, etc.) for field validation in incoming request DTOs and trigger these validations with @Valid in Controller method parameters. Add custom handling for MethodArgumentNotValidException in the global exception handler. |
| C5 | Convert roles to Enum | 🟢 Low | ⭐⭐ | Define user roles using Java Enum for type safety. |

## 🔐 Security Improvements

| ID | Task | Priority | Difficulty | Description |
|----|------|----------|------------|-------------|
| S1 | Password complexity validation | 🔴 High | ⭐⭐ | Enforce the use of strong passwords meeting defined complexity rules (minimum length, uppercase/lowercase letters, numbers, special characters, etc.) during user registration and password update processes. Perform this validation in the service layer. |
| S2 | Rate limiting for login attempts | 🔴 High | ⭐⭐⭐ | Implement rate limiting using Bucket4j or Resilience4J. |
| S3 | Add CSRF tokens to forms | 🔴 High | ⭐⭐ | Enable Spring Security CSRF protection for form submissions. |
| S4 | Account lockout after failed attempts | 🟡 Medium | ⭐⭐⭐ | Implement account locking using Spring Security features. |


## 🚀 Feature Improvements

| ID | Task | Priority | Difficulty | Description |
|----|------|----------|------------|-------------|
| F1 | Product Import/Export (CSV, Excel) | 🔴 High | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Implement bulk data operations using Apache POI or OpenCSV. |
| F3 | Product image upload & preview | 🟡 Medium | ⭐⭐⭐ | Implement file upload using MultipartFile and cloud storage integration. |
| F4 | Marketplace Integration (Etsy) | 🔴 High | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Create abstracted integration layer using Facade or Adapter design patterns to support different marketplace APIs (starting with Etsy). Implement product synchronization, order management, and inventory updates using Spring's RestTemplate or WebClient. |

## 🧪 Testing Improvements

| ID | Task | Priority | Difficulty | Description |
|----|------|----------|------------|-------------|
| T1 | Service layer unit tests | 🔴 High | ⭐⭐⭐ | Write comprehensive unit tests for all public methods in the service layer, where business logic resides, using JUnit 5 and Mockito. Ensure the code's correctness and that it exhibits the expected behavior. |
| T2 | Controller integration tests | 🟡 Medium | ⭐⭐⭐ | Write integration tests using Spring MVC Test (MockMvc) or @SpringBootTest with TestRestTemplate to test if API endpoints are working correctly, requests are processed properly, and appropriate responses are returned. |
| T3 | Test coverage reports (JaCoCo) | 🟡 Medium | ⭐⭐ | Generate test coverage reports using JaCoCo to measure and track how much of the code is covered by tests. Integrate these reports into the CI/CD process to continuously monitor code quality. |

## ⚙️ DevOps Improvements

| ID | Task | Priority | Difficulty | Description |
|----|------|----------|------------|-------------|
| D1 | CI/CD pipeline setup | 🔴 High | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Set up a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or Jenkins to automatically build, test (including unit and integration tests), and deploy code changes to selected environments (dev, staging, prod). Include steps for packaging the Spring Boot application (JAR/WAR) and creating a Docker image. |
| D2 | Docker health checks | 🟡 Medium | ⭐⭐ | Configure container health monitoring with Spring Boot Actuator. |
| D3 | Logging & monitoring (ELK) | 🟡 Medium | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Set up centralized logging and monitoring using ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or Grafana Loki for log collection and analysis. Integrate Prometheus and Grafana with Spring Boot Actuator to collect and visualize application metrics. |

## 📄 Documentation

| ID | Task | Priority | Difficulty | Description |
|----|------|----------|------------|-------------|
| DOC1 | Swagger/OpenAPI documentation | 🔴 High | ⭐⭐ | Generate API documentation using Springdoc-openapi. |
| DOC2 | Developer onboarding guide | 🟡 Medium | ⭐⭐ | Create comprehensive guide covering project setup, architecture overview, coding standards, and development workflow to help new developers quickly become productive. |
| DOC3 | Database documentation | 🟡 Medium | ⭐⭐ | Create detailed documentation of the database schema, including entity relationships (ERD), table structures, indexes, and constraints to help developers understand the data model. |

## 🔚 Conclusion

The tasks listed above are meticulously structured to systematically enhance the technical excellence, security, performance, and user experience of the Stockify project's Spring Boot-developed infrastructure. Completing the 🔴 High priority tasks will establish a solid foundation for future developments. These improvements leverage Spring ecosystem best practices and tools.
