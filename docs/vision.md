# Stockify 2025 Project Documentation

## 1. Brand Vision and Positioning

Stockify is a next-generation SaaS brand aiming to provide scalable, reliable, and data-driven inventory management solutions to a wide range of users—from small-scale Etsy entrepreneurs to global omnichannel retailers. The brand promise transforms “inventory display” from a passive dashboard into a strategic decision-support system that boosts profitability.

## 2. Updated Technology Stack

Stockify is built on **Spring Boot 3.5** running on Java 21 LTS. By leveraging Spring Framework’s ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation and GraalVM Native Image support, the container size is minimized and startup times are reduced to milliseconds. The data persistence layer uses PostgreSQL 16, with high-read traffic cached by a Redis 7 cluster. Real-time metrics are collected via Micrometer, Prometheus, and Grafana, while distributed tracing is enabled with OpenTelemetry and Jaeger. The front-end is a standalone React 19 + TypeScript single-page application (SPA) that communicates with the back-end through REST and gRPC via Spring Cloud Gateway.

## 3. Architectural Principles

The application combines package-based “Modulith” principles with Clean Architecture layering. Core domain logic resides in the **Core** module, while **Inventory**, **Order**, **Analytics**, **Integration**, and **Notification** modules are defined with clearly delineated boundaries. Each module declares its dependencies using `module-info.java`, and exposed APIs are contract-tested with `spring-modulith`. External integrations (Etsy API, supplier EDI, Stripe, QuickBooks) are implemented through port-and-adapter pairs.

## 4. Commercial Inventory Management Capabilities

Stockify goes beyond simple SKU counting by incorporating advanced algorithms to drive profitable growth. Economic Order Quantity (EOQ), safety stock, and reorder points are automatically calculated using historical sales data and Facebook Prophet trend forecasting. ABC-XYZ analysis classifies SKUs for capital optimization. Batch-lot tracking and multi-warehouse stock synchronization are natively modeled in the core domain. FIFO, LIFO, and Weighted Average Cost methods are fully supported, and IFRS-compliant COGS reports can be exported.

## 5. Quality, Security, and Compliance

All services can operate within a zero-trust service mesh (Istio) using mutual TLS. Authentication and authorization rely on Spring Authorization Server with OAuth 2.1 and PKCE. Passwords are hashed with Argon2id and validated against corporate password policies via Hibernate Validator. FIDO2/WebAuthn hardware key support is available. The system is designed to meet PCI-DSS and GDPR requirements, with field-level encryption (pgcrypto) at the database.

## 6. Performance and Scalability

Deployments run on Kubernetes with horizontal scaling. Intensive analytical workloads execute in a separate **analytics-worker** Kubernetes Job pool, isolating them from real-time operations. Connection pooling uses PgBouncer and HikariCP optimizations. Redis Streams manage low-latency inventory event queues, and critical thresholds trigger event-driven reactor flows.

## 7. Observability and Operations

Each module emits traces via the automatic OpenTelemetry agent, and JSON-formatted logs are shipped to Loki. Health checks include Spring Boot Actuator liveness/readiness endpoints plus custom **inventory-drift** and **forecast-lag** probes.

## 8. CI/CD and Deployment Model

GitHub Actions pipelines use Maven Wrapper, Trivy security scans, and Testcontainers for integration tests. A successful build deploys to staging via Helm Chart and promotes to production via ArgoCD declarative sync. Blue/Green deployments manage traffic shifting, and database migrations use a Flyway + Liquibase hybrid.

## 9. Roadmap (2025 Q3 → 2026 Q4)

* **2025 Q3:** Launch multi-store (multi-tenant) support.
* **2025 Q4:** Release beta of the mobile companion app built with Flutter.
* **2026 Q1:** Introduce AI-driven supplier scoring and dynamic pricing optimization engine.
* **2026 Q2:** Complete ISO 27001 certification.
* **2026 Q3:** Add offline inventory counting PWA feature.
* **2026 Q4:** Deliver integration package for global marketplaces (Amazon, Shopify, eBay).

## 10. Task Pool and Prioritization

**Core Refactoring:** Implement layered architecture, global error handling, and configuration profiles.
**Security Priorities:** Migrate to Argon2id password hashing, implement rate limiting, enforce CSRF protection, and enable 2FA.
**Core Features:** Stock alerts, bulk import/export, media management, and advanced filtering.
**Operational Improvements:** Add Docker health checks, enhance observability dashboards, and optimize backup strategies.
**Testing and Quality:** Achieve 80% unit test coverage in the service layer, implement integration tests for controllers, and publish JaCoCo reports.

This comprehensive document aligns Stockify with industry best practices across technical, commercial, and operational dimensions, ensuring its trajectory toward becoming a global leader in inventory management.
